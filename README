This is a command-line script for getting a job. It's
written in  Python, the preferred programming language
of the unemployed. 

Right now, it has options to search AuthenticJobs by
keyword and location. Output can be piped to grep
for filtering -- eventually it will look nice without
having to do things like that.

If you have urlview, it can cut through the bullshit
and cull the URLs from your query's matched listings
so as to display them to you legibly.

It's PRE-ALPHA right now, which means it can't actually
get you a job at the moment. Use at your own risk
and enjoy. 

Yes!
